  `,
  stanSuccess: dedent`
    Done! You're now stanning %(bias). It may take a few minutes to show up.
  `.trim(),
  ultSuccess: dedent`
    ðŸ’– let's goooo~ %(bias) is now your ult. It may take a few minutes to show up.
  `.trim(),
  ultOnlyOne: dedent`
    We have to keep the number of ults down or we'll be here all day. Use /reset to start over.
  `.trim(),
  stanMax: dedent`
    I want to list everyone too, but we have to limit somewhere~
  `,
  resetSuccess: dedent`
    Okay, we reset your stan & ult lists. This is who you had before:

    %(list)
  `,
  help: dedent`
