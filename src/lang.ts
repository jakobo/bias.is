    Here's the groups and individuals you stan, plus your current ðŸ’– ult
  `,
  addSuccess: dedent`
    Done! You're now following %(bias)s. It may take a few minutes to show up.
  `.trim(),
  ultSuccess: dedent`
    ðŸ’– let's goooo~ %(bias)s is now your ult. It may take a few minutes to show up.
  `.trim(),
  ultOnlyOne: dedent`
    We have to keep the number of ults down or we'll be here all day. Use /reset to start over.
  `.trim(),
  addMax: dedent`
    I want to list everyone too, but we have to limit somewhere~
  `,
  resetSuccess: dedent`
    Okay, we reset your stan & ult lists. This is who you had before:

    %(list)s
  `,
  help: dedent`
